                Twins <strong>Eva Newsie</strong> and <strong>Lynn Newsie</strong> have been related 
                to each other for their whole lives. At the age of 
                six, both the girls were born without a face. Many
                know the <a href="#">incredible story of Lynn Newsie</a>, popular 
                fashion model for beanies, hair ties, and hats.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a shocking recent turn of events, Eva Newsie,
                older sister of Lynn Newsie, <a href="#">has sued her younger
                sister for plagiarism</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                "It's my face," claimed Eva, shouting very loudly
                through the class 5 hurricane she insisted our
                interviewers meet her out in. "I'm the oldest, I
                had it first. I should be getting a cut of the
                cheese." She refused to speak further on the matter.

            <p>
                You heard that right: Eva Newsie is suing beloved
                hat model Lynn Newsie because they look the same,
                and Eva claims to have had the look first. What has
                the world come to for two sisters to be driven 
                apart over profit. <em>This is why we can't have nice
                things.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Lynn Newsie gave no comment, but her manager
                indicated that their team would not be backing down
                from the challenge. Head manager, <strong>Boneless Tim</strong>, had
                this to say:
            </p>


            <p>
                "I invoke my right to settle this matter via 
                gladiatorial combat." Boneless stated. "These utter
                fools believe I am just some mere manager. But one
                day I shall rule this pitiful planet, and all of you
                will know my name as your God's."
            </p>

                As far as we here at Sage Daily can tell, the drama
                and heartbreak surrounding the two sisters will not
                by ending anytime soon.

<!--
You are going to recreate the front page of a newspaper using block, 
    inline and inline-block elements.

Your newspaper should have:
    -A header with the name of your newspaper
    -A title for the front page article
    -A body with a story.
    -Several words in the body should be individually styled using 
        inline elements. (i.e. highlighting, bolding, or text-color change)

Come up with your own story. It can be anything, including satire or the 
    recreation of an existing article somewhere. Make sure it looks nice so 
    that someone could obviously tell it's suppose to be a newspaper.

Extra Credit:
Add a "Classifieds" section to your the newspaper. Title at top (block), 
classifieds cards with borders (inline-block), some of them could have 
images, whatever else you want to add.
