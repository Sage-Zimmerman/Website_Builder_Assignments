                <p class="pclass">
                    Twins <strong>Eva Newsie</strong> and <strong>Lynn Newsie</strong> have been related 
                    to each other for their whole lives. At the age of 
                    six, both the girls were born without a face. Many
                    know the <a href="#">incredible story of Lynn Newsie</a>, popular 
                    fashion model for beanies, hair ties, and hats.
                </p>

                <p class="pclass">
                    In a shocking recent turn of events, Eva Newsie,
                    older sister of Lynn Newsie, <a href="#">has sued her younger
                    sister for plagiarism</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="pclass">
                    "It's my face," claimed Eva, shouting very loudly
                    through the class 5 hurricane she insisted our
                    interviewers meet her out in. "I'm the oldest, I
                    had it first. I should be getting a cut of the
                    cheese." She refused to speak further on the matter.
                </p>

            <div class="papercolumn">

                <p class="pclass">
                    You heard that right: Eva Newsie is suing beloved
                    hat model Lynn Newsie because they look the same,
                    and Eva claims to have had the look first. What has
                    the world come to for two sisters to be driven 
                    apart over profit. <em>This is why we can't have nice
                    things.</em>
                </p>

                <p class="pclass">
                    Lynn Newsie gave no comment, but her manager
                    indicated that their team would not be backing down
                    from the challenge. Head manager, <strong>Boneless Tim</strong>, had
                    this to say:
                </p>


                <p class="pclass">
                    "I invoke my right to settle this matter via 
                    gladiatorial combat." Boneless stated. "These utter
                    fools believe I am just some mere manager. But one
                    day I shall rule this pitiful planet, and all of you
                    will know my name as your God's."

                    As far as we here at Sage Daily can tell, the drama
                    and heartbreak surrounding the two sisters will not
                    by ending anytime soon.

<!--
You are going to recreate the front page of a newspaper using block, 
    inline and inline-block elements.

Your newspaper should have:
    -A header with the name of your newspaper
    -A title for the front page article
    -A body with a story.
    -Several words in the body should be individually styled using 
        inline elements. (i.e. highlighting, bolding, or text-color change)

Come up with your own story. It can be anything, including satire or the 
    recreation of an existing article somewhere. Make sure it looks nice so 
    that someone could obviously tell it's suppose to be a newspaper.

Extra Credit:
Add a "Classifieds" section to your the newspaper. Title at top (block), 
classifieds cards with borders (inline-block), some of them could have 
images, whatever else you want to add.
